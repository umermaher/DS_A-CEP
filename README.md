# Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection
In the pursuit of advancing fraud detection methodologies, having access to comprehensive financial datasets is crucial. However, the scarcity of such data has presented a significant hurdle for researchers in the field. To address this challenge and facilitate robust research in fraud detection, our project leverages a synthetic dataset created by PaySlim. This dataset, although simulated, is designed to emulate real-world financial scenarios. By utilizing this dataset for research purposes, our aim is to develop highly accurate fraud detection systems that can be instrumental in safeguarding financial systems and transactions.
