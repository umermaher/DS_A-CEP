# Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection
In the pursuit of advancing fraud detection methodologies, having access to comprehensive financial datasets is crucial. However, the scarcity of such data has presented a significant hurdle for researchers in the field. To address this challenge and facilitate robust research in fraud detection, our project leverages a synthetic dataset created by PaySlim. This dataset, although simulated, is designed to emulate real-world financial scenarios. By utilizing this dataset for research purposes, our aim is to develop highly accurate fraud detection systems that can be instrumental in safeguarding financial systems and transactions.

# End Dataset Source
Beside the origin of dataset, we collected the dataset from Kaggle.com and has been preprocessed for research purposes. The dataset includes synthetic transaction that replicates the normal transaction.
